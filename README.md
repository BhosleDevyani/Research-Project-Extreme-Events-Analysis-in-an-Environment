# Research Project: Extreme Events Analysis in an Environment

## Project Background
- This project investigates the statistical modeling of rare and impactful environmental events such as extreme rainfall and temperature spikes.
- It uses Extreme Value Theory (EVT) to understand the behavior of such events and estimate their future risk under climate variability.

## Objectives
- Analyze and define thresholds to classify extreme events across environmental datasets.
- Study and apply suitable distributions like GEVD and GPD for modeling tails of environmental variables.
- Estimate return levels to evaluate the expected magnitude of rare events over fixed periods (e.g., 50-year or 100-year events).

## Methodology
- Collected environmental data with a focus on extreme rainfall occurrences.
- Performed threshold selection for identifying exceedances using statistical diagnostics.
- Conducted in-depth study of Generalized Extreme Value Distribution (GEVD) and Generalized Pareto Distribution (GPD).
- Applied GPD to model extreme rainfall data from Meghalaya and estimate corresponding return levels.
- Used R software and specialized EVT packages for model fitting, diagnostics, and visualization.

## Key Findings
- Identified optimal thresholds and validated the heavy-tail behavior of rainfall extremes.
- GPD model successfully captured the frequency and intensity of high-rainfall events in Meghalaya.
- Estimated return levels revealed the magnitude of extreme events likely to occur once in 10, 50, or 100 years.
- Demonstrated how EVT-based models provide better insight into environmental risks compared to traditional methods.

## Conclusion
- EVT provides a rigorous statistical framework to assess and predict rare environmental phenomena.
- Return level estimation is crucial for infrastructure planning, disaster preparedness, and long-term climate resilience.
- This project highlights the practical application of GPD modeling to real-world environmental challenges, supporting data-driven risk assessment and mitigation strategies.
